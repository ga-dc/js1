# Movie Browser

Use the [Open Movie Database API](http://www.omdbapi.com/) to build a single-page movie browser app.

## Requirements

 1. The `"#movie-select"` should be hidden by default.

 2. When the user may submits a search for a movie keyword...
  - the `"#movie-select"` field should be un-hidden,
  - it should be populated with all search results,
  - and the first select option should read "Movies matching `keyword`â€¦".

 3. Whenever the user selects a title from the `#movie-select` field (HINT: listen for a `"change"` event), the app should populate the `"#movie-detail"` div with that movie's title and poster image.

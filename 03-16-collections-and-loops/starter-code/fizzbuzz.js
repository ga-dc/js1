/**
 * FizzBuzz Excercise

 Relying on newfound knowledge of loops, combine loops and if/else statements together and incrementally build the common fizzbuzz loop.

 - In the loop every time a number is divisible by **3**, instead of logging the number itself, the word "fizz" should appear.
 - If the number is divisible by  **5**, the word "buzz" should be logged.
 - If the number is divisible by both **3** and  **5**, then the word "fizzbuzz" should be logged.

 Follow the steps below.

 ##### Step 1:
 Construct a for loop that iterates through, and `console.log()`'s out, numbers 1 - 100.



 ##### Step 2:
 Add an `if/else` statement that logs the string `"fizz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `3`; otherwise, log out the value.



 ##### Step 3:
 Add an `else if` clause that logs the string `"buzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by `5`.



 ##### Step 4:
 Add an additional `else if` clause that logs the string `"fizzbuzz"` if the value being iterated over is divisible by both `3` and `5`. __Note:__ this step is intentionally broken! Place the new `else if` __below__ the evaluations for `fizz` and `buzz`; after running the code, and experiencing the undesired results, prompt the students as to why the `fizzbuzz` evaluation never occurred.


 ##### Step 5:
 Fix the above code to evaluate the `fizzbuzz` condition:

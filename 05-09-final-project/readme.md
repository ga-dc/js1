### Overview

For the final project, you'll be designing and building a web app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of JavaScript and ask you to apply everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a web app that you can add to your portfolio. You could create anything from: a blog users can comment on; an app that allows users to search for social media posts; or even an application that logs users geolocations. Work with your instructor to create project goals that are realistic given the scope and timing of the class.

### Technical Requirements

- Use JavaScript to correctly structure the code for a web application:
  - Structure your application to be a SPA (single page application)
  - Make HTTP requests to our self-hosted parse server
  - Make at least one HTTP request to a third-party server
  - CRUD functionality should be present
  - Use either vanilla JS or jQuery to perform DOM manipulation
  - Listen for events and add interactivity based on user input

- Hosting
  - App must be hosted on GitHub Pages

#### Bonus / Best Practices

  Your instructor will provide feedback on how well you execute best practices. Even though it is not part of the requirements, you should keep these in mind:

  - __Clean And Readable Code__. The instructor should be able to read and follow your code easily.  Maintain clean and readable code including: consistent indentation, code commenting and use of proper and consistent naming conventions.

  - __Object Oriented and/or Functional__. Implement function closures, keep code modular, maintain a separation of concerns, only put code on the global scope when absolutely necessary, use prototypical inheritance.

### SPA Architecture

Single Page Applications (SPA) are all the rage today. The single page aspect of a SPA refers to a single page coming from the server, such as our _index.html_ page.  Once loaded, the SPA changes views by using _client-side_ routing, which loads partial HTML snippets called templates. Think back to our _Advanced APIs_ lesson where we showed specific views based off the login state of a user. The goal for you implementing a SPA is to not make users have to refresh the entire DOM every time they need a new piece of data to be represented in the UI.

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **production ready web application**, SPA, hosted live on the web.
* A  **new git repository hosted on Github** where codebase is maintained.
* A 5-10 minute **presentation** including 3 technical hurdles, 2 new things you learned, Q&A.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Think of a problem in the world, or even in your personal life, and apply what you've learned to build an application that can help solve the issue.
- Research different social media APIs (i.e. twitter) and see what kind of information you can use from them.
- Look at different online [video games](http://phaser.io/examples) for inspiration.

### Potential Project Ideas

##### Idea 1
Movie forum site where users can post their favorite movies and rate them.

##### Idea 2
Celebrity follower app that allows users to easily pull all social media data from their favorite celebrities.

##### Idea 3
Friend locator site that allows users to see how far away they are from their friends.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Technical Requirements__: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

* __Creativity__: Did you added a personal spin or creative element into your project submission?

* __Code Quality__: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as tab indentation, DRYness, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

* __Problem Solving__: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way?

* __Total__: Your instructor will give you a total score on your project between:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **1** | _Meets expectactions, good job!_
    **2** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Store and use anonymous functions in variables.
- Pass functions as arguments to functions that expect them.
- Write functions that take other functions as arguments.
- Return functions from functions.

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Implement an AJAX request with Vanilla JS.
- Reiterate the benefits of separation of concerns â€“ API vs. Client.
- Understand the difference between function declarations and function expressions.
- Understand scope and hoisting.

> Note: Last class, we learned how to implement an AJAX request with Vanilla JS and a jQuery AJAX client. Check with students to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the materials covered in the last class.

## Introduction to Asynchronous JavaScript (10 min)

As our programs start relying on user input/behavior and data that might not be available right away, we need to increasingly start thinking about manipulating our program behavior spread out over a period of time. We refer to this "now and later" programming as asynchronous programming. Believe it or not, we have already used asynchronous programming in our code in previous lessons:

- We have listened for click and mouse events that execute certain code when that event is complete.
- We have waited for a return from an AJAX call, and we have executed code for success and error scenarios.
- We have used native JavaScript functions such as `setTimeout` that ran code after a number of milliseconds.

Although we have used asynchronous programming in our code, we have not discussed _how_ this is all happening. Before we can truly understand how asynchronous programming works in JavaScript, we need to take a deeper look at functions and scope.

## Anonymous Functions and Functions as First-Class Objects: Recap (15 min)

We have worked with numerous scenarios where we have run a block of code after a user has performed an action. Take the following scenario from our DOM and jQuery continued lesson:

```js
  var $thingListItems = $('#fav-list');

  $thingList.on('mouseleave', 'li', function(e) {
    ...
  });
```

Taking a close look at the jQuery `on()` method, we notice two very important overlooked concepts:

1. The function we are passing into the `on()` method does not have a name, we are just passing the function keyword with an event (e) parameter.
2. The `on()` method is taking a function as one of its parameters.

##  Functions as First-Class Objects (60 min)

Functions as "first-class objects" is one of JavaScript's most powerful superpowers. It allows us to pass functions as parameters, store them as variables (function expressions), return them from other functions, or just run them ad-hoc without the need to define anything. A function that takes another function or returns a function is called a `higher-order function`.

In the above example we saw a function being passed through jQuery event, but JavaScript also has a plethora of built functions that allow us to pass functions as parameters. Let's take a look at the setTimeout function:

```js
  setTimeout( function(){
      console.log( "Hello world" );
  }, 1000 );
```

In this scenario setTimeout is taking a function as its first parameter, and the timer (in milliseconds) as its second parameter. The syntax for defining our own function that takes a function parameter is not any different than the syntax of a function that takes an argument:

```js
  var countDown = function() {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }

  function launchRocket(countDownFn, rocketName) {
    countDownFn();

    function printRocketMessage() {
      console.log( "Launching " + rocketName);
    }

    printRocketMessage();
  }

  launchRocket(countDown, "Falcon");
```

The above should all look familiar. There is however one thing to note with the printRocketMessage. This is referencing the `rocketName` argument that's defined on its parent's scope. Although this is not different from overall scope that we've already covered, this piece of functionality of a function keeping reference to variables from parent scope, even when parent has returned, is called a _closure_.

Nomenclature: **callbacks**. It's important to understand the nomenclature around the above example, as this will become a fundamental pattern in our asynchronous programming. The function being passed into `launchRocket` is acting as a `callback`, because it serves as the target for the event loop to call back into the program, whenever the item in the queue has processed.

Callback functions can also take arguments, even though we don't specify the need for arguments when we're passing the function expression variable, since this acts as a reference:

```js
  var countDown = function(verb) {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(verb + ": " + counter);
    }
  }

  function launchRocket(countDownFn, rocketName) {
    countDownFn("Counting");
  }

  launchRocket(countDown, "Falcon");
```

Just like we can pass functions as parameters, we can also return functions:

```js
  var countDown = function() {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }

  function launchRocket(countDownFn, rocketName) {
    countDownFn();

    return function() {
      console.log("Launching " + rocketName);
    }
  }

  var firstRocket = launchRocket(countDown, "Falcon");
  firstRocket();

  var secondRocket = launchRocket(countDown, "Dragon");
  secondRocket();
```

The above pattern of returning functions allows our functions and callbacks to become more powerful in that we can generate much more dynamic and flexible functions.

Finally let's put everything we've learned the past two lessons together, and separate our concerns:

```js
  var countDown = function() {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }

  function launchRocket(countDownFn, rocketName) {
    countDownFn();

    return function() {
      return "Launching " + rocketName;
    }
  }

  var firstRocket = launchRocket(countDown, "Falcon");
  console.log(firstRocket());

  var secondRocket = launchRocket(countDown, "Dragon");
  console.log(secondRocket());
```

## Functions and Callbacks: Independent Practice (30 mins)

Open the [main.js](starter-code/functions-callbacks-exercise/js/main.js) file.

- Write a function, `makeCountWhereTrue()`, that returns a function returning the number of odd integers in an array.
- `makeCountWhereTrue()` should take a predicate/filter function and return a function, allowing us to enter an array of numbers.

## Anonymous Functions and IIFEs (30 min)

By this point we have seen various examples of function expressions being passed as callback parameters. Taking the first setTimeout example:

```js
  setTimeout( function(){
      console.log( "Hello world" );
  }, 1000 );
```

The above is called an **anonymous function expression** because the function we're passing into `setTimeout()` has no name identifier in it. This is important to understand that function expressions can be anonymous, but function declarations cannot omit the name.

Although it is perfectly legal for us to use anonymous function expressions, and many examples take advantage of them them, including ones we have used up to date, we need to set a new best practice in place. As we increasingly work with function expressions, we should from this point on start naming all of our function expressions because it makes it much easier to stack trace and our code becomes much more readable. So let's change the above code to no longer be an anonymous function:

```js
  setTimeout( function timer(){
      console.log( "Hello world" );
  }, 1000 );
```

**Invoking Function Expressions Immediately**

We have the ability to execute our function expressions as soon as they are declared. This pattern has become so commonplace, that the JS community gave it a name: Immediately-invoked function expressions (IIFE - pronounced "iffy"). We are familiar with this syntax:

```js
  var countDown = function() {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }
```

We can transform this to an IIFE and execute the function expression immediately by adding parenthesis at the end of the expression:

```js
  var countDown = function() {
    var counter;
    for(counter = 3; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }
  }();
```

Note that we need to add a semicolon at the end of IFFEs.

IIFEs are just functions, so we can also pass arguments to them:

```js
  var counterStartPoint = 3;

  (function countDown( global ){
    var counter;
    for(counter = global.counterStartPoint; counter > 0; counter--) {
      console.log(counter);
    }

  })( window );

  console.log( counterStartPoint ); // 3
```

The above example highlights a common stylistic practice. Although IIFEs are commonly used with global objects, they can certainly be used inside an enclosing scope.

## IIFE: Independent Practice (30 min)

Open the [main.js](starter-code/iife-exercise/js/main.js) file.

- Write an IIFE function that takes a timer argument.
- The function will automatically execute and count up every second until the specified argument.
- Use the setTimeout function to count up.
- Hint: a second is the timer passed * 1000 (milliseconds).

## Conclusion (5 min)
Callbacks and closures are the bread and butter of asynchronous programming. Looking back at our DOM and APIs lessons, our interfaces update on user interactions and/or once we receive data from remote locations. Best practices in JS call for these reactions to be handled in the form of callbacks.

Callbacks, closures, and IIFEs allow us to better organize our code for each scenario, as well as make our functions significantly more dynamic.

Make sure class objectives have been met.

## Homework

Before the next class, make sure that students sign up for an Instagram developer account. **We strongly recommend that students do this before coming to class, as Instagram can block too many requests to create new accounts coming from the same IP address (i.e. the wireless router in the classroom)**. We've created a [set of sign up instructions](instagram.md) that you can pass along to students. In the next class, you'll be reviewing the steps that students took to sign up and then leading an exercise that uses the Instagram API.

**Optional homework:** Students who want an additional challenge can try to complete [this series of functional-programming JavaScript exercises](http://reactivex.io/learnrx/). Be sure to warn students that some of these exercises use methods and syntax that we haven't covered in class and which they will likely need to look up on their own.
